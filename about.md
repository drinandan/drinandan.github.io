I am a <b>data scientist</b> interested in leveraging data to answer business questions. I have experience in a variety of machine learning, analytical, and statistical techniques.

In a previous life, I was an academic specializing in population/conservation genetics with research that focused on using genetics to answer questions of concern for species management.
